To run the project:

cd insight_testsuite
./run_tests.sh

Problems Faced:

In the batch_payment.txt & stream_payment.txt files downloaded from Dropbox, there were some lines with '\n ' 

for eg. 

2016-11-02 09:49:11, 72122, 36143, 31.06, Total Due       Cost Split - Michael to Pay     Date to be Paid
 JP HOSA Dues paid in August - 35.00     $17.50
 CCP Cheer Shoes paid in August - 80.00  $40.00
 CCP Frequency paid in August - 215.00   $107.50
 SUBTOTAL        $165.00
 Susan Paid for Claires contacts $220 the 70/30 rule means Michael owes Susan $145.2 of that amount       Michael Paid Jacks contacts and glasses $363 (30% that is due from Susan is $119.79) - the difference between what were Claires costs and Jacks means that Michael owes Susan $25.41
 AMOUNT TO PAID TO SUSAN $355.41         11/6/15 


So the lines 12-17 have been skipped.
